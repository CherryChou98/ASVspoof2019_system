# Anti-spoofing System Towards Robust Replay Attack Detection

This repo contains the implementation of our work towards building a more robust replay attack detection system. We propose an informative and  complementary feature representation and leverage a more effective training objective. Experimental results in terms of min-tDCF and EER, as well as more detailed analysis will be reported in this repo.
